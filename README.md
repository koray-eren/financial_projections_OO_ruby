## Statement of Purpose

Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:

* describe at a high level what the application will do
* identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
* identify the target audience
* explain how a member of the target audience will use it

* This application aims to facilitate more informed financial decisions on the part of the user.
* The user can see the long term impact of their current financial position, as well as explore the potential impact of various changes.
* The hope is that this application may offer value to all users regardless of their level of financial literacy.

* The application allows the user to enter financial inputs, and project forward these inputs an arbitrary number of years.
* The user can add customisable income, expenses, assets, and liabilities.
* The user can adjust assumptions such as indexation, projection length, and tax rate.
* The customisability of the app also facilitates 'what if' modelling, whereby the user can explore the impact of unexpected financial conditions to their position, particularly negative ones. For example, what if a given investment experiences a lower than expected return, or the user were to lose their income, or interest rates were to increase?

* There are two main sections to the app - managing inputs & viewing outputs (as well as one or two auxiliary features)
* The user enters their desired inputs, and can view the output derived from them
* Inputs: assets, income, expenses, liabilities
* Outputs: cashflow table, assets & liabilities table

* wish list: graphs and charts, 

* Both projecting forward their current financial position, and exploring various hypothetical scenarios can help a user answer various important financial questions such as:
  * When can I retire?
  * Which investment attributes are better over the long term?
  * What will my situation look like if interest rates go up?
  * How much can I afford to spend?

## Scope and Limitations

* Compounding is annual for all projections, and other compounding options are not provided
* All calculations are start of period.
* This calculator does not include any form of social security benefits.
* This calculator does not attempt to calculate income tax as per the relevant legislation. Instead, tax is applied at a flat rate of 30%, with the first $20,000 of taxable income being tax-free.

## Features

DESCRIBE EACH FEATURE (AT LEAST 3)

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:

* use of variables and the concept of variable scope
* loops and conditional control structures
* error handling

* **Income**
* **Expense**
  * test
* hide some years? i.e. only print every 5 years, or project to retirement, but only print the first 10 years of retirement
* customisable years

***Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient***

## User Experience

Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:

* how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
* how the user will interact with / use each feature
* how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

## Diagram

Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:

* show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
* utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML

## IMPLMENTATION PLAN

DONE ON TRELLO

Develop an implementation plan which:

* outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
* prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
* provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.
